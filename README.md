## Overview of the Statistical Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to get a good grasp of our consumer demographic. The big picture is trying to figure out why the number of males out numbers the females by such a high margin. It seems that the time of the day, day of the week, and location all have no signifant correlation to the difference in gender counts. Although, the number of unknown customers could have an effect on the data. It could prove useful to pull demographics of the city and compare the gender in the overall population to see if there is a relevant skew in favor of males. 

## Results

To begin, I found it useful to give the full scale gender counts in the form of a pie graph. That gives a viewer a good idea of the difference in male to female.

The trip duration gives a broad idea of what the trip is for. From the data we can see that it is typically used for a short distance.

This image shows that males and females are typically using the bikes for the same duration. The unknown gender does not follow the same trend.

This heat chart gives more of an idea of what the bikes are used for. The busiest times are after normal working hours.

![Story 1 (4)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104074135/194221937-1b67e50a-b349-43a2-9142-4e044d5ea611.png)

Another heat chart, but this one separates by gender. Looking at the data, female and male follow the same trend in which the popular times are 5-6PM and 8-9AM. Again, these are common working hours.

![Story 1 (5)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104074135/194221948-9cea41b3-c851-4ac9-8ee1-3a8a9074596e.png)

Here we are with data that separates customer and subscriber along with gender. Most customers are an unknown gender. This could have some sort of impact on the count difference between female and male.

![Story 1 (6)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104074135/194221956-0568b60a-ba38-49e7-8ee3-2bb8c38cbe86.png)

This is a map that gives the starting location for citibikes. It is separated by gender. There is not much of a difference between female and male again other than the scaling. If we can assume that citibikes are being used for workplace travel, then it could be useful to look at what types of businesses are located near citibike stations.

![Story 1 (7)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104074135/194221964-9ba5c8f2-e60e-4b57-8b3a-0b652c9f615e.png)


## Summary

Overall, in this data we are not able to provide a concise reason as to why there is such a difference in gender counts using citibike services. With the gender breakdown data from the module, we are able to see that there is almost three times as many males as females. It is useful to show that concise difference because it shows that there is an untapped market. The start location could have a lot to do with females not using our services. The areas may accommodate to males more than females in many ways; for example businesses that are primarily slotted with male dominant careers. There could also be higher crime rates by male in these areas which would turn away females. At this point, we can make educated assumptions as to how to get more females using citibikes, or we could pull more data and delve into a deeper analysis.
